          I'm a passionate front-end developer with a vested interest in
          designing and creating responsive web apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in front-end development started with my interest in
          design, where I began using Figma and Adobe programs such as Photoshop
          and Illustrator. I later leveraged my graphic design background to
          conceptualize and draft user interfaces to implement using my in-depth
          knowledge of React, a popular front-end framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy collaborating with peers to create amazing projects, as well
          as combining my experience with design and front-end technologies to
          make responsive web applications.
