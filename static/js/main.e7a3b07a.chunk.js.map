Established in 2018, the OAA is an opportunity for\n              students and alumni from all programs to exhibit and sell their\n              work, encouraging OCAD U students as artists and small businesses.\n              The OAA aims to support and inspire creatives by providing a\n              platform to sell, network, and build confidence within their\n              community.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <img />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n          <img />\n          <div className=\"proj-page-card-text\">\n            <p>\n              However, due to the pandemic, the OAA was forced to move online,\n              and a website was hastily constructed in order to provide a venue\n              to sell student works. The current OAA website is a modified\n              Tumblr blog, which comes with several disadvantages, such as no\n              functionality for vendors to upload and modify their own listings,\n              as well as multiple design oddities that are a result of trying to\n              transform a personal blog into an e-commerce site.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n          <div className=\"proj-page-card-text\">\n            <p>\n              My project is a rebuilt version of the OCAD Artist Alley website.\n              It seeks to address the major shortcoming of the original OCAD\n              Artist Alley website, being unable to allow vendors to upload,\n              modify, or delete their own listings. As a result of this project,\n              there is a more accessible, easy to use portal for OCADU students\n              to sell their works.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <img />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n        <div className=\"proj-page-card-text\">\n          <h1>Research and Development Process</h1>\n          <p>\n            I created layouts in Figma to declare a consistent design for the\n            final website, helping me decide topics such as the layout of the\n            site, design of the product cards, displaying product filters, and\n            vendor sign-in. These are all central features since the beginning\n            of this project that have now found a place in the redesign.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <img />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n        <img\n          src={\n            process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/img/ocad-artist-alley/artist-alley-2.png\"\n          }\n        />\n        <img\n          src={\n            process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/img/ocad-artist-alley/artist-alley-4.png\"\n          }\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n        <div className=\"proj-page-card-text\">\n          <p>\n            After creating the layouts, I used React with Chakra UI components\n            to build the site. To handle user authentication and data storage, I\n            used Firebase. I learned how to use the Firebase API to communicate\n            with the real time database and perform create, read, update, and\n            delete operations, as well as using the same API to register and\n            delete users. However, the free version of Firebase is limited in\n            data storage, so storing images on the database was not possible. To\n            work around this, I decided to have the user provide a url to an\n            image of the listing, hosted on another site. This allows me to\n            insert the url into the site and display the image without having to\n            host the image myself. The app was deployed using Heroku.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <img />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n        <img />\n        <div className=\"proj-page-card-text\">\n          <h1>Testing</h1>\n          <p>\n            During testing, I received feedback about the form that handled\n            listing submission. Testers pointed out that letters should not be\n            possible to insert in the price field, and that it should be clear\n            that a dollar sign will be appended automatically to all prices, so\n            users don’t have to type in their own dollar sign. Another piece of\n            feedback I received was about the field where users put in a url to\n            an image of their listing. Testers were confused about the field,\n            expecting to be able to upload an image to the site instead. Since\n            images aren’t stored in the database, this is not possible, and the\n            intention is for the user to host their image on another site such\n            as imgur, and paste the link into the form.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n        <div className=\"proj-page-card-text\">\n          <p>\n            To address this issue, I wanted to make the form field more clear,\n            making sure that the user understands that a url is supposed to be\n            in the field, and not an image upload. Before, the title of the\n            field was “Listing Image”, which was confusing for the user. To\n            better convey the proper usage of the field, I changed the title to\n            “Listing Image Url”, and added tooltip text that would appear on\n            hover explaining the issues with data storage and why a url to the\n            image is needed instead. The styling of the form was also improved\n            to better match the wireframe layout. I also restricted the price\n            field to only accept numerical inputs, and added a dollar sign next\n            to the field to communicate to the user that a dollar sign would be\n            appended automatically to their input.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <img />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"proj-page-card\" style={{ display: \"block\" }}>\n        <h1>Submit Form - Before and After</h1>\n        <div>\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\n              \"/img/ocad-artist-alley/artist-alley-6.png\"\n            }\n          />\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL +\n              \"/img/ocad-artist-alley/artist-alley-5.png\"\n            }\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"proj-page-card\">\n        <div className=\"proj-page-card-text\">\n          <h1>Onboarding Graphics</h1>\n          <p>\n            In addition, any vendors are expected to register on the site and\n            upload their products onto the site. For this to be possible, they\n            must know how to navigate the site and use the upload form\n            correctly. As a result, I made some onboarding graphics to help\n            orient new users to the functions of the site. These graphics walk\n            them through how to create an account and upload, edit, and delete\n            listings.

The current OAA website is a modified Tumblr blog, which comes with several disadvantages, such as no functionality for vendors to upload and modify their own listings, as well as multiple design oddities that are a result of trying to transform a personal blog into an e-commerce site. `,\n      `My project is a rebuilt version of the OCAD Artist Alley website.

As a result of this project, there is a more accessible, easy to use portal for OCADU students to sell their works.`,\n      `I created layouts in figma to declare a consistent design for the final website, helping me decide topics such as the layout of the site, design of the product cards, displaying product filters, and vendor sign-in.

Other technical specifications\n        included being able to add and remove movies from the nomination list, disabling nomination buttons of already nominated movies, as well as \n        letting the user know when they've nominated 5 movies.`,\n      `I began by drafting designs for web user interface in Figma. I wanted to make the link to Shopify's brand obvious, so the colour green was \n        chosen as a secondary colour. To further reinforce the link to Shopify, I created a quick mockup of a movie-based Shopify logo in Photoshop.`,\n      `I heavily referenced Google's Material Design guidelines while brainstorming, and eventually settled on a card-based method for displaying the movie results.\n        I decided to divide the main content of the page between the movies grid and the nominations panel, the latter of which would follow the user\n        as they scrolled through the page. Users would click on the green button below each movie to nominate it, and it be added to the \n        nominations panel on the right. By taking these steps, I ensured the finalized design would be visually sharp and easy to navigate.`,\n      `In order to make the design responsive, I also planned for a mobile variant of the user interface. Many elements that were previously side-by-side, such as the\n        nominations panel and movie cards, were rearranged on top of each other to account for the decrease in horizontal space.`,\n      `Before coding any components, I made a basic search box to communicate with the OMDB API using the Axios client, to make sure I could submit queries and receive\n        information correctly. After I confirmed the API was being called correctly, I moved to implementing the user interface in React. While using Figma, I intentionally made self-contained\n        elements with clear boundaries so they would be easy to code, such as the nominations box, the movie cards, and header. Once the components and \n        functionality were in place, I styled the app using CSS and added media queries to ensure a responsive design.`,\n      `Before finishing my project, I made some minor touch-ups and included a link to the repo in the header, a pop-up\n        when the user submits their nominations, and a favicon.

This page would \n        appear at the end of each course, testing the user on the content they learned. The format of the page remained consistent,\n        with only the question changing. The redesign would need to keep the functionality of the old version while improving\n        on its shortcomings.`,\n      `One of the flaws of the original design I focused in on was the lack of responsive design. The old design (seen right) was built\n        for 4:3 aspect ratios and did not resize to fit 16:9 screens. This resulted in a large amount of empty space and often made\n        text difficult to read.`,\n      `Since the functionality wouldn't change in the redesign, I first began by mapping out the user flow of the old version so that\n        I could mimic it in the redesign. This included different screens if the user picked the right/wrong answer, as well as a button\n        to submit the exam when all questions are answered.`,\n      `I used Figma to create a basic redesigned exam template page. I focused on designing a responsive page that could resize to fit\n        both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios. I also used flat colours and simple shapes to make it look more modern and legible.\n        In addition, I made sure the design was flexible, that it would be able to resize to long answers and questions.`,\n      `While the appearance of the design is important, I also wanted to consider how it felt to interact with the interface. I used\n        Figma's prototyping function to add interactivity to my designs to mimic the user flow. This way, anyone who was reviewing my design\n        would have an idea of how a typical user would interact with it.`,\n      `After seeing the possible paths the user could take in the old design to complete the test, I used the template to mirror all the paths in\n        the redesigned version.
