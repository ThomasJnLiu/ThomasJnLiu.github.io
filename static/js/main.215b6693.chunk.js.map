The current OAA website is a modified Tumblr blog, which comes with several disadvantages, such as no functionality for vendors to upload and modify their own listings, as well as multiple design oddities that are a result of trying to transform a personal blog into an e-commerce site. `,\n      `My project is a rebuilt version of the OCAD Artist Alley website.

As a result of this project, there is a more accessible, easy to use portal for OCADU students to sell their works.`,\n      `I created layouts in figma to declare a consistent design for the final website, helping me decide topics such as the layout of the site, design of the product cards, displaying product filters, and vendor sign-in.

Other technical specifications\n        included being able to add and remove movies from the nomination list, disabling nomination buttons of already nominated movies, as well as \n        letting the user know when they've nominated 5 movies.`,\n      `I began by drafting designs for web user interface in Figma. I wanted to make the link to Shopify's brand obvious, so the colour green was \n        chosen as a secondary colour. To further reinforce the link to Shopify, I created a quick mockup of a movie-based Shopify logo in Photoshop.`,\n      `I heavily referenced Google's Material Design guidelines while brainstorming, and eventually settled on a card-based method for displaying the movie results.\n        I decided to divide the main content of the page between the movies grid and the nominations panel, the latter of which would follow the user\n        as they scrolled through the page. Users would click on the green button below each movie to nominate it, and it be added to the \n        nominations panel on the right. By taking these steps, I ensured the finalized design would be visually sharp and easy to navigate.`,\n      `In order to make the design responsive, I also planned for a mobile variant of the user interface. Many elements that were previously side-by-side, such as the\n        nominations panel and movie cards, were rearranged on top of each other to account for the decrease in horizontal space.`,\n      `Before coding any components, I made a basic search box to communicate with the OMDB API using the Axios client, to make sure I could submit queries and receive\n        information correctly. After I confirmed the API was being called correctly, I moved to implementing the user interface in React. While using Figma, I intentionally made self-contained\n        elements with clear boundaries so they would be easy to code, such as the nominations box, the movie cards, and header. Once the components and \n        functionality were in place, I styled the app using CSS and added media queries to ensure a responsive design.`,\n      `Before finishing my project, I made some minor touch-ups and included a link to the repo in the header, a pop-up\n        when the user submits their nominations, and a favicon.

This page would \n        appear at the end of each course, testing the user on the content they learned. The format of the page remained consistent,\n        with only the question changing. The redesign would need to keep the functionality of the old version while improving\n        on its shortcomings.`,\n      `One of the flaws of the original design I focused in on was the lack of responsive design. The old design (seen right) was built\n        for 4:3 aspect ratios and did not resize to fit 16:9 screens. This resulted in a large amount of empty space and often made\n        text difficult to read.`,\n      `Since the functionality wouldn't change in the redesign, I first began by mapping out the user flow of the old version so that\n        I could mimic it in the redesign. This included different screens if the user picked the right/wrong answer, as well as a button\n        to submit the exam when all questions are answered.`,\n      `I used Figma to create a basic redesigned exam template page. I focused on designing a responsive page that could resize to fit\n        both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios. I also used flat colours and simple shapes to make it look more modern and legible.\n        In addition, I made sure the design was flexible, that it would be able to resize to long answers and questions.`,\n      `While the appearance of the design is important, I also wanted to consider how it felt to interact with the interface. I used\n        Figma's prototyping function to add interactivity to my designs to mimic the user flow. This way, anyone who was reviewing my design\n        would have an idea of how a typical user would interact with it.`,\n      `After seeing the possible paths the user could take in the old design to complete the test, I used the template to mirror all the paths in\n        the redesigned version.
